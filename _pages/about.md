I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/academic-programs/grad/biostatistics" target="_blank">Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/radiology/" target="_blank">Department of Diagnostic Radiology</a> at <a href="http://mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill Univeristy</a>. <!--I previously did my PhD in Biostatistics under the supervision of <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/" target="_blank">Celia Greenwood</a> and <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/" target="_blank">Yi Yang</a>.--> I am broadly interested in developing statistical methods for high-dimensional data using penalized regression methods. My current work is focused on <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/ggmix/blob/papel/manuscript/source/ggmix_manuscript_v1.pdf" target="_blank">penalized mixed models</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/sail/blob/Papel/manuscript/source/sail_manuscript_v2.pdf" target="_blank">non-linear interactions</a>. I previously developped a <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/eclust/" target="_blank">methodological approach</a> for identifying clusters of features that are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gepi.22112">sensitive to environmental exposures</a>. I'm also interested in <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/" target="_blank">survival analysis methods</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=manhattanly" target="_blank">interactive plots</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/knitr-tutorial" target="_blank">reproducible research</a>.

Prior to my current training, I completed a BSc in Actuarial Science at <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/actuarial-mathematics.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a> and worked in pension plan administration and valuations for 4 years at a consulting firm in Montreal. During this time I became an <a href="https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-asa-req.aspx" target="_blank">Associate of the Society of Actuaries</a>. I then went on to complete an MSc in Biostatistics from <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/" target="_blank">Queen's University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://post.queensu.ca/~pengp/" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Peng</a> and <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~cdlin/" target="_blank">Dr. Devon Lin</a>. -->
