I am currently a Biostatistics PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/academic-programs/grad/biostatistics" target="_blank">Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health</a> at <a href="http://mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill Univeristy</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/" target="_blank">Celia Greenwood</a> and <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/" target="_blank">Yi Yang</a>. 
<br><br>
I am broadly interested in developing statistical methods for synthesizing genomic data using penalized regression methods. My current work is focused on <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Estimation_for_High-Dimensional_Multivariate_Linear_Mixed_Models_in_Structured_Populations/5405317" target="_blank">multivariate mixed models in structured population</a> and <a href="https://ssc.ca/en/meeting/annual/2017/presentation/strong-heredity-penalized-regression-models-non-linear-gene" target="_blank">non-linear interactions</a>. I previously developped a methodological approach for identifying clusters of features that are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/102475">sensitive to environmental exposures</a>. This <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/eclust/" target="_blank">method</a> was used to understand genetic signatures that are associated with bodyfat measures in children born to women who had a gestational diabetes mellitus-affected pregnancy. I'm also interested in <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/" target="_blank">survival analysis methods</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=manhattanly" target="_blank">interactive plots</a>.

Prior to my current training, I completed a BSc in Actuarial Science at <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/actuarial-mathematics.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a> and worked in pension plan administration and valuations for 4 years at a consulting firm in Montreal. During this time I became an <a href="https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-asa-req.aspx" target="_blank">Associate of the Society of Actuaries</a>. I then went on to complete an MSc in Biostatistics from <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/" target="_blank">Queen's University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://post.queensu.ca/~pengp/" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Peng</a> and <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~cdlin/" target="_blank">Dr. Devon Lin</a>. -->
