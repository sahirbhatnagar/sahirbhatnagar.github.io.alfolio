I am currently a Biostatistics PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/academic-programs/grad/biostatistics" target="_blank">Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health</a> at <a href="http://mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill Univeristy</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/" target="_blank">Dr. Celia Greenwood</a>, <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~blanchem/" target="_blank">Dr. Mathieu Blanchette</a> and <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/" target="_blank">Dr. Yi Yang</a>. 
<br><br>
I am broadly interested in developing statistical methods for synthesizing genomic data. My current work is focused on developing a methodological approach for identifying clusters of features that are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/102475">sensitive to environmental exposures</a>. This is motivated by the fact that environmental exposures may induce subtle system-wide changes in high-dimensional genomic data such as gene expression or epigenetic measures and hence this assumption can possibly be exploited to aid analysis of high dimensional data. These methods have been applied to understand genetic signatures that are associated with bodyfat measures in children born to women who had a gestational diabetes mellitus-affected pregnancy. The method, called <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/eclust/" target="_blank">ECLUST</a>, is available as an <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=eclust" target="_blank">R package on CRAN</a>. I also developped an R package called <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=manhattanly" target="_blank">manhattanly</a> to create interactive Q-Q, manhattan and volcano plots. You can hear about the manhattanly package by watching my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sawf9fnbsOA" target="_blank">Plotcon talk in New York city</a>.
<br><br>
I am also working on penalized regression methods for analyzing interactions between a high dimensional dataset (e.g. genomics, brain imaging) and the environment. Specifically, methods that impose the strong heredity principle, i.e., the interaction term will only have a non-zero estimate if its corresponding main effects are estimated to be non-zero. I have written an R package for this method available on <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/shim/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I have also been working on a method to fit smooth-in-time parametric hazard functions using case-base sampling. The R package <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/" target="_blank">casebase</a>, allows the explicit inclusion of the time variable into the model, which enables the user to fit a wide class of parametric hazard functions. It can also be used to fit competing risk models, and create  <a href="http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/popTime/" target="_blank">population time plots</a>.
<br><br>
Prior to my current training, I completed a BSc in Actuarial Science at <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/actuarial-mathematics.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a> and worked in pension plan administration and valuations for 4 years at a consulting firm in Montreal. During this time I became an <a href="https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-asa-req.aspx" target="_blank">Associate of the Society of Actuaries</a>. I then went on to complete an MSc in Biostatistics from <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/" target="_blank">Queen's University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://post.queensu.ca/~pengp/" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Peng</a> and <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~cdlin/" target="_blank">Dr. Devon Lin</a>.
