  description: I am a resident physician in General Surgery at McGill University. Since completing an MSc in Epidemiology as part of the 
              Surgeon Scientist Program, I am currently pursuing a PhD in Experimental Surgery at McGill University. My research focuses on the 
              surgical outcomes of Colorectal Surgery patients, making use of large administrative databases, institutional data, and prospective 
              trials to answer various clinical questions. Specifically, I am interested in the management and outcomes of patients with rectal 
            cancer and diverticulitis. I am co-supervised by Dr. Marylise Boutros.

  previously: Undergraduate student
  now: PhD student in Human Genetics in Dr. Simon Gravel's lab under the Kyoto-McGill International Collaborative Program in Genomic Medicine
  description:  Graduated from McGill with a Bachelor of Quantitative Biology, I studied the statistics from Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Dual Energy CT scans under Dr. Sahir Bhatnagarâ€™s supervision. Dual Energy CT is a new diagnostic method that reconstructs scanning images at multiple energy levels. I investigated whether the additional information is better at identifying the tumour signal in comparison to conventional single energy image.
                I am currently a Human Genetics PhD student . I am studying how evolution affected patterns of variation encoded in our genome and among populations.

  description:  My name is Peter and I'm a U3 undergraduate student at McGill University pursuing a major in Pharmacology. I was born in Montreal and love the winter. I was given the opportunity to learn the principles of data science with the help of Dr. Bhatnagar. While also applying them by helping out on a COVID-19 mobility project where I manipulate, visualize and analyze data.

  description:  Currently a final year undergraduate in McGill, Mathematics major and Computer Science minor, Pursuing a Data Science Master degree and internships. Field of interests in Machine Learning and Database System. My Research is calling C++ within R to compute Tuning-free ridge estimators for high-dimensional generalized linear models to improve the spend and wrap it into a r package. I also have an ongoing research in Causal Inference mainly designing causal inference models for further practical applications.
