  description: I am a resident physician in General Surgery at McGill University. Since completing an MSc in Epidemiology as part of the 
              Surgeon Scientist Program, I am currently pursuing a PhD in Experimental Surgery at McGill University. My research focuses on the 
              surgical outcomes of Colorectal Surgery patients, making use of large administrative databases, institutional data, and prospective 
              trials to answer various clinical questions. Specifically, I am interested in the management and outcomes of patients with rectal 
            cancer and diverticulitis. I am co-supervised by Dr. Marylise Boutros.
