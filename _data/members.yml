  description: Sahir Bhatnagar is a Biostatistician and Assistant Professor in the Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, and Diagnostic 
               Radiology at McGill University. His work focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing high-dimensional data in genomics and 
               radiomics. He is a proponent of open-source software and has authored several R packages which have been downloaded over 100K times according 
               to official CRAN logs. He enjoys working on multidisciplinary teams and has active collaborations with epidemiologists, colorectal surgeons, radiologists, 
               and human geneticists. His M.O. is the bio comes before statistics in the word biostatistics, i.e., the biological question drives his methodological contributions.

  description:  Currently a final year undergraduate in McGill, Mathematics major and Computer Science minor, Pursuing a Data Science Master degree and internships. Field of interests in Machine Learning and Database System. My Research is calling C++ within R to compute Tuning-free ridge estimators for high-dimensional generalized linear models to improve the spend and wrap it into a r package. I also have an ongoing research in Causal Inference mainly designing causal inference models for further practical applications.

  description:  My name is Peter and I'm a U3 undergraduate student at McGill University pursuing a major in Pharmacology. I was born in Montreal and love the winter. I was given the opportunity to learn the principles of data science with the help of Dr. Bhatnagar. While also applying them by helping out on a COVID-19 mobility project where I manipulate, visualize and analyze data.
