  description: Sahir Bhatnagar is a Biostatistician and Assistant Professor in the Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, and Diagnostic 
               Radiology at McGill University. His work focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing high-dimensional data in genomics and 
               radiomics. He is a proponent of open-source software and has authored several R packages which have been downloaded over 100K times according 
               to official CRAN logs. He enjoys working on multidisciplinary teams and has active collaborations with epidemiologists, colorectal surgeons, radiologists, 
               and human geneticists. His M.O. is the bio comes before statistics in the word biostatistics, i.e., the biological question drives his methodological contributions.
