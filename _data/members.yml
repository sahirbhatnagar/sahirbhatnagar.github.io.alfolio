  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"} 
              and a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. Nationally, I serve on the [Neuroethics Working Group](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

  description:  My curiosity about the underlying mechanisms of human behavior led me to become a UC Davis biopsychology major, where I spent my time as an undergraduate entrenched in cognitive neuroscience research. 
                I was fortunate enough to work under the guidance of (then) graduate student, [Dr. Trevor Brothers](https://trevorbrothers.com){:target="\_blank"}, whose contagious passion for linguistics, desire to teach,
                and electrophysiological expertise gifted me the foundation necessary to work in Dr. Steve Luck's [Laboratory for Basic and Translational Cognitive Neuroscience](https://lucklab.ucdavis.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.
                After getting a grasp on EEG/ERPs and extending my interest in language processing to attention and visual working memory, I decided to take a break from research and gain clinical experience as a pyschometrist 
                in hopes of understanding cognition from a different vantage point. Combining my clinical and research experience, I was eager to revisit academia and join the Decision Lab to contribute to science once again.


                Upon joining the lab, I started working on the [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma) study, where I collected data and worked to crack the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences analysis. 
                I later transitioned to developing E-Prime and Qualtrics instruments during my ownership of organizing the multi-national ALLFTD (ARTFL-LEFFTDS) recruitment for our [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) project. 
                Although my responsibilities have recently shifted to see that the lab runs smoothly, I hope to continue developing my understanding of statistics and programming. 


                When I'm not working, I enjoy singing songs about my favorite Liverpool FC players, rock climbing, playing soccer, and, more recently, unsuccessfully prospecting for gold!

  description:  The Decision Lab is the perfect home for my interdisciplinary interests. I received my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where I conducted research on Alzheimer’s disease. While there I also took several philosophy courses, which introduced me to the field of bioethics. 
                I became so enamored with the subject that I went to study for a Master’s in Bioethics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. I had the opportunity to conduct work with a lab studying deep brain stimulation as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression. 
                My thesis project analyzed patient perspectives to respond to the ethical concerns and implications of DBS for depression, particularly as it relates to themes of identity.
                
                
                My experience in neuroethics and neurotechnology led me to San Francisco and UCSF, where I work as a research coordinator in the Decision Lab for the [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies](/projects/index.html#neurotech) study. 
                The project involves observing and interviewing patients, caregivers, and providers in order to identify and respond to concerns regarding the ethics of closed-loop deep brain stimulation. I see value in the perspectives that these narratives can provide as we develop best practices for novel neurotechnologies. 
                More broadly, however, I am also curious as to how such advancements in therapeutic technologies can challenge our society’s perception of itself and its values. Beyond this project, I also organize the [Neuroethics Seminar](/seminar/), a twice-monthly interdisciplinary discussion on ethics-related questions that arise from neuroscience research and clinical neurology practice. 
                
                
                In my free time, I enjoy keeping up to date with the newest films and shows, trying to find the best bites in San Francisco, and pretending that I am half as good at rock climbing as the rest of the SF population.

  description:  Research was an integral part of my undergraduate experience at Stanford University, where I spent four years studying dynamic stem cell behaviors and tumor development. Working at the bench ignited my curiosity to explore and solve difficult questions about the natural world.
  
  
                Though bench research consumed much of my time in these four years, I also dedicated time for community engagement work with vulnerable low-income and migrant communities.
                One experience I deeply cherish is my years spent volunteering at the university's pediatric hospital, where I got the opportunity to connect with migrant children living with a host of conditions and diseases. Their spirit was a grounding and reassuring force for me all throughout
                college. 
                
                
                For a long time, these two parts of my life remained separate. It gradually became apparent to me, however, the disconnect between my research and the patients I interfaced with in the hospital and the wider community. My efforts to find an intersection between these two led me to the Decision Lab, where I 
                manage the [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma) study. I am excited to extend my love for research to a clinical field that centers on the individual and the human experience.
                
                
                In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking comfort food, volunteering with migrant communities, and watching YouTube videos.

  description: I am transitioning from a former career as a Ballet dancer to a field of medicine, science, and groundbreaking clinical research. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Performing Arts Degree in the Liberal Education for Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s College of California. I am also earning an
               Associate’s degree in the field of Biological Sciences at Canada College. Among several extracurricular activities, I also enjoyed being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the Alpha Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
  
  
               While focusing on my artistry as a ballerina, I enjoyed traveling the world and experiencing unique cultures. In my dance career, I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman Award, among other newspaper and magazine features.
               While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always knew that I would like to go into medicine one day. 
 
 
               I discovered my passion for research during my time as an NIH researcher in the Bridges to Baccalaureate Program through SF State University. In this program, I acquired laboratory skills and presented on various research projects. I enjoy volunteering at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and at Shanti 
               Project, where I was grateful to be named the Spotlight Volunteer in Shanti’s Spring 2019 Newsletter. I am thrilled to provide emotional support and practical assistance for both children in the hospital and assisting aging adults with disabilities in Shanti.
 
 
               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in researching and assisting with projects that enhance their quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why I’m 
               excited about the work that I am doing as a member of the Decision lab, specifically on the [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) Project. The insightful knowledge, experience, and abilities I will learn while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare me for my future as a physician and researcher.
 
 
               In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.

  description:  I first obtained my BA in psychology (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece). As a bachelor thesis student, I was introduced to the fascinating world of research by undertaking a behavioral study probing the association between cheating, creativity and moral reasoning. The question which psychological mechanisms tilt our moral compass sparked my interest. 
                However, pieces were definitely missing from understanding such a perplex topic in depth. 
                
                
                
                My MS in Neural and Behavioural Sciences (University of Tubingen, Germany) provided a bigger piece to the puzzle by giving me the opportunity to work out interdisciplinary questions such as how cognitive enhancers affect cheating upon monetary payoff (Oxford University, UK) and how arousal mediates different contexts of lying (Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, Germany).
                
                
                
                Now, being part of the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to add another, major piece, dementia. In other words, investigating conditions characterized notably by impairment of memory and judgment.
                In the lab, I am responsible for fMRI task design, data collection and analysis for the [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma) and the [Online Studies of Decision-Making in Healthy Aging](/projects/index.html#agingcog) projects. 
                Some questions I am eager to examine is how moral reasoning, dishonest behavior and overall value based decision making processes are altered in different types of dementia, including corresponding brain areas.

                 
                In my free time I enjoy dancing, hiking and camping. When I experience a rush of adrenaline I am most likely trying to surf.

  description: During my undergraduate studies I was able to accumulate a broad range of experiences.  I received my B.S. in Physiology and became involved with research through studying and completing my Honors thesis project on the effects of amniotic membrane application on post-infarct cardiac remodeling.
              Additionally, I received a minor in Health and Human Values which introduced me to the way social, political, and institutional values, norms, and policies affect the health of different patient populations.
              
              
              To supplement my understanding of these concepts, I worked as an intern developing a cervical cancer screening intervention at a family clinic with a largely underserved patient population.
              I also completed a capstone project highlighting ways the current sex education system fails to provide adolescents with necessary sexual health information.
              
              
              In addition to these projects, I was able to gain first hand clinical experience by working as an EMT and then later as a patient care technician in the hospital.
              Although I enjoyed being able to interact with patients in these roles, I missed the academic aspect that I experienced working in research.
              
              
              I am grateful to currently be working as a clinical research coordinator in the Decision Lab, as well as Dr. David Perry’s lab, where I am able to work in an integrated clinical and academic environment.
              In the Decision Lab I manage the psychophysiology testing for [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd).  This allows me to interact with current patients, and also contribute to academic knowledge which can inform better health care for future patients.
              
              
              When I’m not at work I enjoy hiking, working out, and trying all of the best brunch places SF has to offer.
