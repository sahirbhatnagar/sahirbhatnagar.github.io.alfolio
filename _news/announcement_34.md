Arthur Ayestas Hilgert, an undergraduate student in my lab, has been awarded a [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp). He will be working on tuning-free ridge regression in high dimensions applied to polygenic risk score prediction. Congrats Arthur!
