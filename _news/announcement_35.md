Jiayi Geng, an undergraduate student in my lab, has been awarded a [McGill Science Undergraduate Research Award (SURA)](https://www.mcgill.ca/science/research/undergraduate-research/sura). She will be working on variable selection for competing-risk analysis using case-base sampling. Congrats Jiayi!
