I'm giving a short course on [Data analysis using penalized regression methods](http://ism.uqam.ca/health-analytics//en/program.html) at the McGill Summer School in Health Data Analytics on May 9th, 2019. Slides available [here](/assets/pdf/Bhatnagar_penalized_regression_McGill_Health_data_analytics_2019_repaired.pdf).
